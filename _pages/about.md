I am Min-Gyu Kim, a medical doctor-scientist currently located in Korea.

I am mainly interested in:

- information theory
- statistical learning

and how these fields should be implemented in the practice of medicine.

Specifically, I believe advances in modern machine learning will one day be a solid part of medical science. One day, there will be a need for specialized doctors and technicians, similar to how we currently have surgeons, physicians and paramedics for each departments.

I want to be a part in the shaping of such a subspecialty, where knowledge in computer science, statistics and medicine should harmonize to maximize the impact and trustworthyness in the real world.

My current research is centered around three major themes:

- Digital pathology
- Learning-based representation
- Causal inference

I am open to opportunities and suggestions, including research, projects and business. Feel free to contact me through my email.

In my free time, I watch baseball, listen to music, watch movies and play video games. I post about them from time to time, and any recommendation is appreciated.
